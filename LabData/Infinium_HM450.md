## Tumors

#### GSE129364

72 FFPE primary colorectal adenoma without recurrence (n=30), primary adenoma with recurrence at the same location (n=29), so-called “matched pair samples” (n=10; comprising the primary adenoma and the recurrent adenoma) and normal mucosa specimens (n=3). IDATs available.

#### GSE104293

132 IDH-mutant low grade glioma. 87 FFPE samples and 45 fresh frozen samples from patients subject to radiotherapy (RT) or temozolomide (TMZ). "Two of the CpGs correspond to MGMT and consisted of the 2 probes used in the MGMT-STP27 classifier. The extent of methylation was predictive for PFS in the TMZ, but not the RT arm. LGG IDHmt and 1p and 19q codeleted that overlap largely with oligodendroglioma displayed a higher extent of MGMT methylation than the IDHmt non-codeleted tumors based on several independent LGG datasets."
